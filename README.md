E-commerce Customer Support System

This project is an interactive customer support system for an e-commerce platform. It leverages Streamlit for the user interface, Transformers (BERT) for intent classification, and gTTS for generating audio responses. The system handles both text and audio inputs and is designed to provide seamless customer service.

Features

Multimodal Input Handling: Supports both text and audio inputs.
Hybrid Intent Classification: Uses a combination of rule-based logic and a pre-trained BERT model to classify user intents into predefined categories.
Dynamic Response Generation: Provides context-aware responses based on user queries and maintains conversation state.
Audio Response: Converts text responses into speech using gTTS and allows users to download or play the response.
Backend Simulation: Integrates simulated backend responses for real-time data fetching.
Escalation to Human Agent: Transfers complex queries to a human agent when needed.
